Train Ticket Booking System is a Java-based application that simulates a simple train ticket reservation system. It allows users to interact with the application through a menu-driven interface to perform operations like searching trains, booking tickets, and viewing reservation details. The system demonstrates core Java principles such as object-oriented programming, file/ data handling, and validation.

This project is a part of learning practical Java application development and demonstrates how to handle train ticket booking logic efficiently.

Key Features

✔ Search Trains – Users can search for trains available between two stations based on input criteria.
✔ Book Tickets – Book a ticket by entering passenger and journey details.
✔ View Booking – Display details of booked tickets for reference.
✔ Cancel Tickets – Cancel an existing booking and update availability.
✔ Simple Menu Interface – Console-based menu that guides the user through options step by step.
